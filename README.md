# MyMinesweeper
A simple Minesweeper in Java

In this version, the user can choose between 4 levels and those levels determine the size of the grid and the number of mines. The position of mines is chosen randomly and they can be placed in corners. You can flag squares with a right click on it if you think it contains a mine. Another right click will remove the flag. The game ends if you touch a mine (and loose) or if you reveal all squares that are not mines (and win).

Testing program :
Dowload folder from gitHub and make sure that you have at least src/, bin/ and res/ subfolders.
Open project with an adapted software like Eclipse.
